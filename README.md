# Front End Boiler Plate

As the name suggests, this repo provides a simple setup to get anyone started with front-end development based on Gulp and Bower. 

This streamlines the workflow involving the following:
1. Sass compilation
2. JavaScript linting
3. Uglifying
4. Concat/Minifying
5. Cache busting - a couple of simple functions in the gulp file provides a way to capture and append timestamp to source files.
